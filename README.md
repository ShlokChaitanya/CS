# 📘 High School Assignments (Class 11 & 12)

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing all the programming assignments I completed during my high school journey in **Class 11 and Class 12**. This repo is a collection of fundamental programs in Python (or your language), organized by topic and academic class for clarity and learning purposes.

> 💡 _“Code is the language of logic — the more you write, the clearer your thinking becomes.”_

Each folder contains relevant programs and problem statements if available.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

To keep things clean and scalable:

- `main` – Stable, tested and reviewed programs
- `class-11` – All Class 11 assignments and topics
- `class-12` – All Class 12 assignments and topics
- `dev` – For experimental code or work in progress

You can easily contribute or test without affecting the main structure.
